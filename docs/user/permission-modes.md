# Permission modes

Permission modes control when an agent needs your approval to act. Choose a mode in the message
composer; it applies to that thread.

New threads start in **Full access** unless this environment configures a different default.
A configured allowlist hides other modes in the composer. A thread created from another thread
inherits its mode when that mode is still allowed; otherwise it uses the configured default.
The composer label is the mode that will be sent. A request for a disallowed mode is rejected.

| Mode                  | Behavior                                                                              |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Supervised**        | Requests approval for commands and file changes.                                      |
| **Auto-accept edits** | Approves file edits automatically; other actions can still require approval.          |
| **Auto**              | Uses the provider's automatic review to approve routine actions and ask about others. |
| **Full access**       | Allows commands and edits without approval prompts.                                   |

Approve or reject requests in the conversation to let the agent continue. Permission modes do
not prevent the agent from asking questions about the task.

## Provider differences

Providers enforce permissions differently. Some read-only actions can proceed in **Supervised**.
**Auto** uses automatic review on Codex, Claude, and Cursor; providers without an equivalent,
including OpenCode and Antigravity, fall back to asking.

For Grok, **Always allow this session** remembers the matching command or tool input. Other
actions still require approval.

Antigravity can still send native approval requests in **Full access**. It only offers remembered
approvals for actions that support them.

See the [provider guides](./install.md#providers) for setup and provider-specific limits.
